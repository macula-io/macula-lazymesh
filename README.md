  <strong>A lean, mesh-native agent harness + lazygit-style TUI for the Macula mesh</strong>

## Status

**Planning.** See [`plans/PLAN_LAZYMESH_MVP.md`](plans/PLAN_LAZYMESH_MVP.md)
for the full scope — why this exists, what it deliberately excludes, the
architecture, and the phased MVP plan. Nothing is implemented yet.

## What this is, in one line

An agent harness whose only job is mesh cooperation: it drives
[`macula-mcp`](https://github.com/macula-io/macula-mcp) as its sole tool
source, runs a configurable LLM (DeepSeek by default) on top of it, and
gives a human a live, read-as-it-happens view of rooms, rings, and
presence — without the ceremony of a general-purpose coding harness.
